# raskell.io | Raffael's Tech Blog

Hi, my name is Raffael and this my own web space where I write about tech, the web, open-source, and my life as a software engineer. I write down whatever background noise my mind is producing so I can be more focused when I need to.

## Project Structure

The site is built using Hugo, a powerful and fast static site generator. The Cyberparadism website is structured as follows:

- `content/`: Contains all the markdown files which make up the content of the site. This includes most content such as blog posts and other written materials.
- `static/`: This directory hosts all static content like images, CSS files, or other static files.
- `layouts/`: Holds the HTML templates that define the structure of different types of pages on the site.
- `data/`: Stores configuration files and other data files used by the site.
- `themes/`: Contains the Hugo theme used for the site. Customizations to the theme are also located here.
- `config.yaml`: The main configuration file for the Hugo site. This file contains global settings for the website.
