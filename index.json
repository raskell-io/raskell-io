[{"categories":["code"],"contents":"   Mathematical purity  Haskell is a programming language that has gained popularity in recent years due to its focus on functional programming and mathematical concepts. As a language that emphasizes purity and immutability, Haskell is particularly well-suited to applications in mathematics, data analysis, and other areas where correctness and maintainability are critical.\nAs a math enthusiast, I was naturally drawn to Haskell due to its roots in mathematical theory. Haskell was created by a group of researchers who were interested in creating a language that was as pure as possible. The language was designed to be purely functional, meaning that all computations are performed through the evaluation of functions. This approach allows Haskell programs to be more concise and easier to reason about than programs written in imperative languages like Java or C++.\nIn addition to its mathematical roots, Haskell\u0026rsquo;s focus on purity and immutability also appealed to me as a programmer. As someone who has worked on projects with large codebases, I understand the importance of maintainability and the challenges that can arise when code is difficult to reason about or modify. By focusing on pure functions and immutability, Haskell reduces the potential for bugs and makes it easier to modify code without introducing new problems.\nIn this blog post, I will provide an introduction to Haskell and explore how its focus on pure functions and easy refactoring can make code maintenance easier. I\u0026rsquo;ll also provide some interesting code snippets to help illustrate Haskell\u0026rsquo;s unique approach to programming. Whether you\u0026rsquo;re a seasoned developer or a math enthusiast like myself, I hope that this post will give you a deeper appreciation for the beauty and power of Haskell.\nThis blog post will provide an introduction to Haskell and will explore how its focus on pure functions and easy refactoring can make code maintenance easier.\n   Mister Curry Haskell  Haskell is named after the logician Haskell Curry, who was a pioneer in the field of mathematical logic and contributed significantly to the development of the lambda calculus. The lambda calculus is a mathematical notation system for expressing computation that is closely related to functional programming.\nHaskell was developed in the late 1980s by a group of researchers, including Simon Peyton Jones, Philip Wadler, and others, who were interested in creating a purely functional programming language that was inspired by the lambda calculus. They named the language after Haskell Curry as a tribute to his contributions to mathematical logic.\nHaskell\u0026rsquo;s focus on purity and immutability is closely related to the lambda calculus, which is based on the idea of functions as first-class citizens. In Haskell, functions are treated as values that can be passed around, composed, and evaluated just like any other data type. This approach allows Haskell programs to be more concise and easier to reason about than programs written in imperative languages like Java or C++.\nHaskell also incorporates many features from other functional programming languages like ML and Lisp, as well as concepts from category theory and other branches of mathematics. The language\u0026rsquo;s sophisticated type system, which includes type inference, type classes, and higher-kinded types, is one of its most distinctive and powerful features.\n   The Lambda is the new Alpha  Haskell is closely related to the lambda calculus, which is a mathematical notation system for expressing computation. The lambda calculus was developed in the early 20th century by mathematician Alonzo Church as a way to formalize the notion of computability.\nThe lambda calculus consists of three basic elements: variables, functions, and applications. Variables represent values, functions represent computations, and applications represent the act of applying a function to an argument. For example, the function f(x) = x + 1 could be represented in the lambda calculus as the expression (λx.x + 1).\nHaskell was developed in the late 1980s by a group of researchers, including Simon Peyton Jones, Philip Wadler, and others, who were interested in creating a purely functional programming language that was inspired by the lambda calculus. As mentioned above, they named the language after Haskell Curry as a tribute to his contributions to mathematical logic.\nLike the lambda calculus, Haskell is based on the principles of functional programming, which emphasize the use of pure functions and immutable data structures. In Haskell, functions are first-class citizens that can be passed around and composed just like any other data type. This allows Haskell programmers to create powerful abstractions and write code that is more modular and reusable than in imperative languages like C++ or Java.\nHaskell\u0026rsquo;s type system is also inspired by the lambda calculus, and includes features like type inference, type classes, and higher-kinded types. This allows Haskell programmers to write code that is both statically typed and expressive, reducing the potential for errors while still allowing for elegant and concise code.\nHere\u0026rsquo;s an example of a lambda calculus expression that represents the addition of two numbers:\n$$ (λx.λy.x + y) $$\nIn this expression, λx represents a function that takes an input x, and λy represents a function that takes an input y. The expression x + y represents the sum of x and y.\nTo use this expression to add two numbers, we apply it to two arguments:\n$$ (λx.λy.x + y) 3 4 $$\nIn this case, the expression is applied to the arguments 3 and 4, resulting in the following computation:\n$$ (λy.3 + y) 4 $$\nIn this expression, the function λx has been replaced with the value 3, resulting in a new function that takes an input y and adds it to 3. This function is then applied to the argument 4, resulting in the value 7.\nThis example demonstrates the basic principles of the lambda calculus, where functions are used to represent computations and can be composed and applied in a way that is similar to arithmetic operations. These principles form the basis of functional programming, and have been influential in the development of languages like Haskell, which was designed to be closely aligned with the lambda calculus.\n   One Type System to rule them all  ML (Meta Language) is considered a precursor to Haskell because it is a functional programming language that shares many of the same concepts and ideas. Like Haskell, ML is strongly typed and supports type inference, pattern matching, and higher-order functions.\nML was developed in the 1970s by Robin Milner and others as a tool for writing software that could reason about mathematical objects and proofs. It was initially designed as a metalanguage for describing programming languages, but quickly evolved into a full-fledged programming language in its own right.\nOne of the key features of ML that influenced the development of Haskell is its support for algebraic data types. Algebraic data types allow programmers to define complex data structures by combining simpler types in various ways, using constructs like sums, products, and variants. This allows for a high degree of expressiveness and modularity in programming.\nHaskell also inherits many other features from ML, such as its focus on purity, immutability, and higher-order functions. ML also introduced the concept of type inference, which allows type information to be inferred automatically from the code, reducing the need for explicit type annotations.\n   ELI5: What is Haskell again?  Haskell is a functional programming language that was first developed in the late 1980s. It is named after the logician Haskell Curry and is designed to be purely functional, meaning that all computations are performed through the evaluation of functions. This approach allows Haskell programs to be more concise and easier to reason about than programs written in imperative languages like Java or C++.\nHaskell is a statically-typed language, which means that the type of every expression is known at compile time. This allows the compiler to catch many errors before the program is even run, making it easier to write correct code. Haskell also has a sophisticated type system that allows for powerful abstractions and code reuse.\nOne of the most distinctive features of Haskell is its laziness. This means that expressions are only evaluated when they are needed, allowing for efficient use of resources and the creation of infinite data structures.\n   Getting started with Haskell  To get started with Haskell, you\u0026rsquo;ll need to install the GHC compiler and an editor or IDE that supports Haskell development. Once you have these tools set up, you can start writing Haskell code!\nLet\u0026rsquo;s start with a simple \u0026ldquo;Hello, world!\u0026rdquo; program:\n1 2  main :: IO () main = putStrLn \u0026#34;Hello, world!\u0026#34;   This program defines a main function that prints the string \u0026ldquo;Hello, world!\u0026rdquo; to the console. The :: operator is used to specify the type of the main function, which in this case is IO (). The IO type represents actions that interact with the outside world, like reading from or writing to files.\n   From pure functions to easy refactoring  One of the key benefits of Haskell\u0026rsquo;s functional programming paradigm is that it makes it easy to write pure functions. A pure function is one that has no side effects and always returns the same result given the same input. This property makes pure functions easy to reason about and test.\nLet\u0026rsquo;s look at an example. Suppose we have a function that calculates the factorial of a number:\n1 2  factorial :: Integer -\u0026gt; Integer factorial n = product [1..n]   This function takes an Integer and returns its factorial. We can use it like this:\n1 2  \u0026gt; factorial 5 120   Now suppose we want to optimize this function by memoizing the results. We can do this easily by using Haskell\u0026rsquo;s memoize function:\n1 2 3 4 5 6 7  import Data.Function.Memoize (memoize) factorial :: Integer -\u0026gt; Integer factorial = memoize go where go 0 = 1 go n = n * factorial (n - 1)   The memoize function takes a function and returns a memoized version of it. This means that the function\u0026rsquo;s results are cached for future calls with the same arguments, improving performance.\nNote that we didn\u0026rsquo;t need to change any of the code that calls the factorial function. This is because the function\u0026rsquo;s type signature didn\u0026rsquo;t change, and its behavior is still the same. This is an example of how easy refactoring can be in Haskell. By focusing on pure functions and immutability, Haskell makes it easy to modify code without introducing bugs or breaking existing functionality.\n   Purity as a design goal  Pure functions are functions that have no side effects and always return the same result given the same input. In other words, a pure function\u0026rsquo;s output only depends on its input, and it doesn\u0026rsquo;t modify any external state or perform any I/O operations.\nThis property is desirable for several reasons. First, pure functions are easier to reason about and test. Because they have no side effects, they always produce the same output given the same input, which makes them predictable and easier to verify. This can be especially important in mathematical or scientific contexts where correctness is critical.\nSecond, pure functions can be composed more easily than impure functions. Because pure functions have no side effects, they can be combined or nested in any order without affecting the final result. This makes it easier to write modular and reusable code that can be composed from smaller building blocks.\nThird, pure functions can be more efficient than impure functions in certain contexts. Because pure functions are referentially transparent, meaning that their results depend only on their inputs, they can be memoized or cached to improve performance. This can be especially useful in recursive algorithms or in situations where expensive computations need to be repeated many times.\nThe concept of pure functions is closely related to mathematical theory, particularly the notion of functions in mathematical analysis.\nIn mathematics, a function is a mapping between two sets, where each element of the first set is associated with a unique element of the second set. For example, the function f(x) = x^2 is a mapping from the set of real numbers to the set of non-negative real numbers. Given any real number x, the function f(x) returns the square of that number.\nFunctions in mathematics are often defined in terms of their inputs and outputs, without reference to any external state or context. This is similar to the concept of pure functions in programming, which have no side effects and depend only on their input parameters.\nThe concept of referential transparency, which is central to the idea of pure functions in programming, also has a mathematical counterpart. In mathematical analysis, a function is said to be referentially transparent if it can be replaced by its value without changing the outcome of any other computations. For example, the function f(x) = x + 1 is referentially transparent, because it can be replaced by its value without affecting the outcome of any other computations.\nThe use of pure functions in programming can be seen as an extension of these mathematical concepts to the realm of software engineering. By designing programs in terms of pure functions, we can create software systems that are easier to reason about and test, more modular and reusable, and more efficient in certain contexts. This can lead to more robust and maintainable software systems that are better suited to the demands of modern computing.\n   The side-effects of functional purity  The concepts of immutability, statelessness, higher-order functions, and lazy evaluation are closely related to the idea of pure functions in programming and are highly prominent in the advantages of a programming language like Haskell. By embracing these concepts, we can create software systems that are more robust, efficient, and maintainable.\n  Immutability: Immutability is the concept of not modifying data once it has been created. Immutable data structures are often used in functional programming, because they can make it easier to reason about the behavior of a program. In Haskell, many of the built-in data structures are immutable, including lists, tuples, and sets.\n  Statelessness: Statelessness refers to the concept of not maintaining any internal state between function calls. In other words, a stateless function depends only on its input parameters and has no side effects. Stateless functions are often used in functional programming, because they can make it easier to reason about the behavior of a program.\n  Higher-order functions: Higher-order functions are functions that take other functions as input parameters or return functions as output. Higher-order functions are often used in functional programming to create powerful abstractions and compose smaller functions into larger ones.\n  Lazy evaluation: Lazy evaluation is the concept of delaying the evaluation of an expression until it is actually needed. In Haskell, expressions are evaluated only when their values are required to compute the final result of a program. This can lead to more efficient code, because expressions that are not needed are never evaluated.\n  All of these concepts are closely related to pure functions, because they help enforce the properties of purity and immutability. By using immutable data structures and stateless functions, we can reduce the potential for side effects and create code that is more predictable and easier to reason about. Higher-order functions and lazy evaluation can also lead to more efficient and maintainable code by creating powerful abstractions and reducing the amount of unnecessary computation.\n   Why everyone should learn a Haskell for a great good  One of the benefits of learning Haskell is that it can help you develop a deeper understanding of programming concepts like recursion, higher-order functions, and lazy evaluation. Haskell\u0026rsquo;s focus on purity and immutability can also help you develop good programming habits that can be applied to other languages.\nHowever, despite its many advantages, Haskell is not as commonly used as other programming languages like Java or Python. This is due in part to its steep learning curve and the fact that it is less widely taught in universities and other educational institutions. Haskell also has a smaller community of developers than some other languages, which can make it harder to find resources and support.\nDespite these challenges, there are many reasons to learn and use Haskell. For example, Haskell\u0026rsquo;s focus on purity and immutability can lead to more robust and maintainable code. The language\u0026rsquo;s type system can also catch many errors at compile time, reducing the potential for bugs. In addition, Haskell\u0026rsquo;s focus on functional programming can help you develop good programming habits that can be applied to other languages. Here are some of the reasons why it is worthwhile to learn Haskell:\n Learning Haskell can help you develop a deeper understanding of programming concepts like recursion, higher-order functions, and lazy evaluation. Haskell\u0026rsquo;s focus on purity and immutability can also help you develop good programming habits that can be applied to other languages. Haskell\u0026rsquo;s sophisticated type system can catch many errors at compile time, reducing the potential for bugs. This can lead to more robust and maintainable code. Haskell\u0026rsquo;s focus on purity and immutability can lead to more elegant and concise code that is easier to reason about and test. Haskell is a powerful tool for data analysis, machine learning, and other computational tasks that involve complex algorithms and mathematical models. Haskell is used in industry by companies like Facebook, Google, and Standard Chartered Bank. Learning Haskell can therefore enhance your employability and give you access to interesting job opportunities. Haskell has a small but passionate community of developers who are constantly pushing the boundaries of what is possible with functional programming. This community can provide a valuable source of support and inspiration as you learn and grow as a programmer.     Conclusion  One of the key benefits of Haskell\u0026rsquo;s functional programming paradigm is that it makes it easy to write maintainable code. By focusing on pure functions and immutability, Haskell reduces the potential for bugs and makes it easier to modify code without introducing new problems.\nThe use of pure functions means that code is easier to reason about and test. Pure functions have no side effects and always return the same result given the same input. This property makes them easy to test and reduces the potential for bugs. In addition, pure functions are composable, meaning that they can be combined to create more complex functions. This allows for the creation of highly modular and reusable code, which can simplify the process of maintaining and updating code over time.\nHaskell\u0026rsquo;s emphasis on immutability also contributes to code maintainability. Immutable data structures are less prone to bugs and can be easier to reason about than mutable ones. Immutable data structures also encourage a functional style of programming, which can lead to more concise and elegant code.\nFinally, Haskell\u0026rsquo;s focus on easy refactoring makes it easier to maintain code over time. Refactoring is the process of modifying existing code to improve its structure or performance. In Haskell, refactoring is often as simple as modifying a function\u0026rsquo;s implementation without changing its type signature. This can make it easier to update code to meet changing requirements, fix bugs, or improve performance.\nOverall, Haskell\u0026rsquo;s focus on functional programming, immutability, and easy refactoring makes it an ideal choice for building maintainable code. By reducing the potential for bugs and making it easier to modify code over time, Haskell can help developers create software that is robust and easy to maintain.\n   References and further reading  ","date":"Mar 06","permalink":"https://raskell.io/articles/all-beginning-is-haskell/","tags":["haskell"],"title":"All beginning is Haskell"},{"categories":["foss"],"contents":"   Void Linux as my daily driver  Around six months ago, I decided to ditch my long in the tooth Arch-based setup on my belovest Thinkpad X1 Carbon. I\u0026rsquo;ve been very loyal over the years, and almost came to belive that Arch will be a constant in my adult life. While I kept up with upcoming technologies, I somehow lost track of the ever so diversifying landscape of Linux distributions. It took me a while of constantly coming across a generically named reference to what seemed to be yet another Linux distribution. That outwardly generic sounding name, Void Linux, kept poking my curiosity by supposedly feeling like Arch Linux in the old days, while sharing some substantial DNA with the BSD operating systems. Yet, that\u0026rsquo;s another story I might tell another day, but to remain brief, the BSDs, in particular the infamous OpenBSD with its quite infamous lead developer Theo De Raadt, always were what I considered the endgame. The holy grail of Unix operating systems, so did I think over the decades, FreeBSD, NetBSD and OpenBSD, have always been on my personal radar and I felt I had to earn the intellectual capacity to be able to properly put them at use one day. Last year, when I made the (almost painless) switch from Arch Linux to Void Linux, the simplicity and especially the barebone experience of Void reignited the fascination and the admiration I always had for the BSD operating systems and their philosophy.\nWhile I could write (and definitely will in the near future) about how my journey onto Void Linux and how it has been so far, I preferred to write down, in some like diary, and document every step on how one can approach and ultimately use OpenBSD in 2023. Big disclaimer, I\u0026rsquo;ve yet to install OpenBSD on some baremetal server I ordered some days ago, but dabbled around in the meantime with OS-level virtualization in order to get it running. That\u0026rsquo;s what brings me to libvirt and my surprise to learn that I wouldn\u0026rsquo;t need some full-fledged virtualization solution like the ones offered by VirtualBox or VMWare to efficiently run a virtualized OpenBSD machine. So, ok, let\u0026rsquo;s recap, so far we got the following bill of materials:\n Void Linux as the host system OpenBSD to be virtualized on that host system libvirt as the glue that makes virtualization feel like black magic     From Void to OpenBSD  Before I tell you more about the history of how things went down while setting up OpenBSD, let me give you some basic notions about both Void Linux, being one out of many Linux distributions for the sake of simplicity representing them all as it ended up being my distribution of choice, and OpenBSD. As already mentioned earlier, Void Linux and OpenBSD are both Unix-like operating systems, but they feature enough differences to make them noteworthy. Here are a few similarities and differences between the two:\nWhat is similar:\n Both are free and open-source operating systems. Both use a package manager for software management. Void Linux uses XBPS, while OpenBSD uses pkg_add. Both prioritize security and stability in their development and design. Both feature a version control based package repository, meaning that changes in build definition are managed by pull requests from users.  What is different:\n License: Void Linux is licensed under the MIT License, while OpenBSD is licensed under the ISC License. Philosophy: OpenBSD prioritizes security and privacy, while Void Linux prioritizes simplicity and modularity. Package Management: Void Linux uses a binary package manager (XBPS), while OpenBSD uses a source-based package manager (pkg_add). Package Repository: Void Linux has a large and diverse repository, while OpenBSD has a smaller and more curated repository. Init System: Void Linux uses runit as its init system, while OpenBSD uses rc. None uses the infamous systemd init system.     What is OpenBSD in a nutshell  OpenBSD is a free and open-source operating system that focuses on security, standardization, and robustness. It is based on the Berkeley Software Distribution (BSD) Unix operating system and is developed by a global community of volunteers. OpenBSD aims to provide a secure platform for both personal and enterprise use by implementing strong security features, including access control mechanisms, encryption, and auditing.\nTheo de Raadt is the founder and lead developer of OpenBSD. His main objective with OpenBSD is to create a secure operating system that is free from backdoors, vulnerabilities, and other security weaknesses. He is committed to auditing the source code of the operating system and third-party software included with it, to identify and remove any potential security risks. De Raadt is also dedicated to improving the overall quality of the codebase and ensuring compatibility with a wide range of hardware and software.\nWhat makes OpenBSD really special and stand out is that is developed a suite of tools that got adopted by other OSs like Linux, macOS or even Windows. One of the most famous instances of such adoption is the now de facto standard openssh suite. It actually emerged from within the development circle of the OpenBSD project. OpenBSD also implemented a wide range of OS features that are by now considered staples among other OSs, things like Linux-based OS-level containerization done via the means of cgroups, something that OpenBSD already pioneered and solved with a different spin many years before Linux with pledge and unveil. Go check out Why OpenBSD rocks to get a feel what makes OpenBSD so unique and interesting.\n   Virtualization with libvirt  So now, let\u0026rsquo;s get back to our virtualization endeavour where we would like to virtualize OpenBSD on a Void Linux installation. If you happen to be using another Linux distribution, most of the individual steps would be very similar. That brings me to the next technology we should explain a bit more here, and that is libvirt.\nlibvirt is an open-source virtualization management library that provides a simple and unified API for managing virtualization technologies, including KVM, QEMU, Xen, and others. It aims to simplify the process of creating, managing, and migrating virtual machines, storage, and networks, and to make it easier for administrators to manage virtual environments.\nTo virtualize an operating system like OpenBSD with libvirt, you need to follow these steps:\n Install libvirt and the virtualization technology you want to use, such as KVM. Download the OpenBSD iso file and place it in a location accessible by libvirt. Create a new virtual machine in libvirt with the OpenBSD ISO as the installation media. This can be done through the command line or using a graphical user interface such as virt-manager. Configure the virtual machine, including the amount of memory, CPU, and disk space, to meet the requirements of OpenBSD. Start the virtual machine and install OpenBSD as you would on a physical machine. Once the installation is complete, you can configure the virtual network, storage, and other settings as required. Finally, you can use the libvirt API or the command line to manage and control the virtual machine, including starting, stopping, migrating, and snapshotting.     Step-by-step guide  Let\u0026rsquo;s first install the libvirt package and some related packages which we need in order to connect via VNC. The VNC will provide us with the possibility to use the graphical interface of the running OpenBSD instance.\n1  $ sudo xbps-install -S dbus qemu libvirt virt-manager virt-viewer tigervnc   Now, we need to add our user, in my case raskell, to the libvirt group which got simultanously created with the installation of libvirt.\n1  $ sudo usermod -aG libvirt raskell   OpenBSD features a release cycle of six months. We would need to update our system every six month to keep up with the latest packages. During a given release, only security and bug fix patches are applied to the curated packages maintained by pkg_add. Therefore, in February 2023, we\u0026rsquo;re using the OpenBSD 7.2 release version. As I\u0026rsquo;m living in Switzerland, I chose to pull the iso image from a Swiss mirror, in this case from mirror.ungleich.ch/pub/OpenBSD (check what mirror is closest to you to get the best download rate).\n1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 21 22 23 24 25 26  # cd /var/lib/libvirt/boot/ # sudo wget https://mirror.ungleich.ch/pub/OpenBSD/7.2/amd64/install72.iso --2023-01-12 20:48:15-- https://mirror.ungleich.ch/pub/OpenBSD/7.2/amd64/install72.iso Resolving mirror.ungleich.ch (mirror.ungleich.ch)... 2a0a:e5c0:2:2:400:c8ff:fe68:bef3, 185.203.114.135 Connecting to mirror.ungleich.ch (mirror.ungleich.ch)|2a0a:e5c0:2:2:400:c8ff:fe68:bef3|:443... connected.

This is done with virt-install. Noteworthy here is that we QEMU as our emulation solution of choice, we allocate up to 4GB of RAM and 4 CPU cores to the machine.\n1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11  $ sudo virt-install \\  --name=openbsd \\  --virt-type=qemu \\  --memory=2048,maxmemory=4096 \\  --vcpus=2,maxvcpus=4 \\  --cpu host \\  --os-variant=openbsd7.0 \\  --cdrom=/var/lib/libvirt/boot/install72.iso \\  --network=bridge=virbr0,model=virtio \\  --graphics=vnc \\  --disk path=/var/lib/libvirt/images/openbsd.qcow2,size=40,bus=virtio,format=qcow2   Once, it is up and running, we can use a vnc solution to connect to the running machine. In this case, I chose virsh to do the job. virsh is a command-line interface tool for managing virtualization environments created with libvirt. It allows us to manage virtual machines, storage pools, and network interfaces, as well as other virtualization components, from the command line.\nTo establish a VNC connection with a running libvirt virtualized OpenBSD instance, you can use the following steps:\n Start the virtual machine in libvirt: You can start the virtual machine using the virsh command virsh start \u0026lt;vm-name\u0026gt;, where \u0026lt;vm-name\u0026gt; is the name of the virtual machine you want to start. Find the VNC display: Once the virtual machine is running, you can find the VNC display number for the virtual machine using the virsh command virsh vncdisplay \u0026lt;vm-name\u0026gt;. Connect to the VNC display: You can connect to the VNC display using a VNC client, such as vncviewer, and specify the IP address of the host running the virtual machine and the VNC display number. For example, if the host\u0026rsquo;s IP address is 192.168.0.100 and the VNC display number is :0, the command to connect would be vncviewer 192.168.0.100:0. Authenticate to the VNC server: You may need to enter a password to authenticate to the VNC server. The password is set when the virtual machine is created in libvirt.  With these steps, you can establish a VNC connection with a running libvirt virtualized OpenBSD instance and interact with the virtual machine\u0026rsquo;s graphical user interface.\n1 2  $ virsh dumpxml openbsd | grep vnc \u0026lt;graphics type=\u0026#39;vnc\u0026#39; port=\u0026#39;5900\u0026#39; autoport=\u0026#39;yes\u0026#39; listen=\u0026#39;127.0.0.1\u0026#39;\u0026gt;   Like I did, most of you would like to interact with a graphical interface such as with X11. For that, we yet another tool, a so-called VNC viewer. A very simple implementation of such a vnc viewer is tigervnc (simply install it with $ sudo xbps-install -S tigervnc).\n1 2 3  $ sudo virsh --connect qemu:///system start openbsd Domain \u0026#39;openbsd\u0026#39; started   {tbc}\n   References and further reading   [Guide] how to setup QEMU/KVM emulation on void linux | /r/voidlinux KVM virt-install: Install OpenBSD As Guest Operating System Auto-install OpenBSD on QEMU | skreutz.com  ","date":"Feb 06","permalink":"https://raskell.io/articles/my-openbsd-journey-getting-it-virtualized-with-libvirt-1/","tags":["openbsd, virtualization"],"title":"My OpenBSD journey: Getting it virtualized with libvirt (1)"},{"categories":["meta"],"contents":"   Hello world  Welcome to my tech blog! My name is Raffael Schneider and I am excited to share my rumings about the state of tech, open-source, and the life as a software developer with you.\nIn this first post, I wanted to introduce myself and explain what you can expect to find on this blog. I have been working in the tech industry for several years, and I have experience with a variety of technologies, programming languages, and operating systems. I have a strong interest in open-source software and the principles of open collaboration and sharing that underpin it. Also, I have a passion for tech hardware and the funtional restoration of discarded equipment. The freedom to express oneself with technology to make the world a more comfortable place is a strong focus of mine.\n   Outlook  On this blog, I will be covering a wide range of topics related to technology in general, open-source, operating systems, programming, and tech hardware. Some of the things you can expect to find include:\n My dabblings into new and bleeding-edge technologies in general My experience in using Linux, BSDs, and embedded operating systems Exploration of new and exciting open-source projects Discussion of the latest technology trends and innovations Personal musings and insights into the tech industry  I believe that technology has the power to change the world, and I am excited to be a small part of that change. I hope that this blog will serve as a valuable resource for anyone interested in technology, open-source, Linux, OpenBSD, and programming. I will be posting new content on a regular basis, so be sure to check back often.\nIn my next post, I will dive into a specific topic and share my knowledge and experience. I want to make sure that my readers will learn something new every time they visit my blog.\nThank you for visiting, and I look forward to connecting with you on social media or in real life.\n","date":"Sep 20","permalink":"https://raskell.io/articles/hello-and-outlook/","tags":["raskell"],"title":"Hello and outlook"},{"categories":["themes","syntax"],"contents":"This article offers a sample of basic Markdown syntax that can be used in Hugo content files, also it shows whether basic HTML elements are decorated with CSS in a Hugo theme.\n   Headings  The following HTML \u0026lt;h1\u0026gt;—\u0026lt;h6\u0026gt; elements represent six levels of section headings. \u0026lt;h1\u0026gt; is the highest section level while \u0026lt;h6\u0026gt; is the lowest.\n   H1     H2     H3     H4     H5     H6     Paragraph  Xerum, quo qui aut unt expliquam qui dolut labo.
