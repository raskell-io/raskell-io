## Hello world

Welcome to my tech blog! My name is Raffael Schneider and I am excited to share my rumings about the state of tech, open-source, and the life as a software developer with you.

In this first post, I wanted to introduce myself and explain what you can expect to find on this blog. I have been working in the tech industry for several years, and I have experience with a variety of technologies, programming languages, and operating systems. I have a strong interest in open-source software and the principles of open collaboration and sharing that underpin it. Also, I have a passion for tech hardware and the funtional restoration of discarded equipment. The freedom to express oneself with technology to make the world a more comfortable place is a strong focus of mine.

## Outlook

On this blog, I will be covering a wide range of topics related to technology in general, open-source, operating systems, programming, and tech hardware. Some of the things you can expect to find include:

- My dabblings into new and bleeding-edge technologies in general
- My experience in using Linux, BSDs, and embedded operating systems
- Exploration of new and exciting open-source projects
- Discussion of the latest technology trends and innovations
- Personal musings and insights into the tech industry

I believe that technology has the power to change the world, and I am excited to be a small part of that change. I hope that this blog will serve as a valuable resource for anyone interested in technology, open-source, Linux, OpenBSD, and programming. I will be posting new content on a regular basis, so be sure to check back often.

In my next post, I will dive into a specific topic and share my knowledge and experience. I want to make sure that my readers will learn something new every time they visit my blog.

Thank you for visiting, and I look forward to connecting with you on social media or in real life.
