Haskell was created by a group of researchers who were interested in creating a language that was as pure as possible. The language was designed to be purely functional, meaning that all computations are performed through the evaluation of functions. This approach allows Haskell programs to be more concise and easier to reason about than programs written in imperative languages like Java or C++.</description></item></channel></rss>
